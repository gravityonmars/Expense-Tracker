# Expense Tracker Pro

## Project Description

This application allows users to log expenses by amount and category. It automatically groups similar categories together to provide a clear overview of spending habits. All data is saved locally in the browser, ensuring that information persists even after the page is refreshed.

## Technologies Used

* **HTML5:** Structure and layout.
* **CSS3:** Custom styling and responsive design.
* **JavaScript (ES6+):** Logic, state management, and DOM manipulation.
* **Chart.js:** Data visualization library for rendering charts.

## Setup and Installation

1. Clone or download the project files (index.html, style.css, and app.js).
2. Ensure all three files are in the same folder.
3. Open `index.html` in any modern web browser.
4. No server or installation is required as it runs entirely on the client side.

## Login Credentials

Use the following mock data to access the dashboard:

* **Email:** user@test.com
* **Password:** 1234
